this is a keyboard overlay I made because I had a hard time transitioning to my corne lp.

#Future goals
- fix 'long pressed' keys these are annoying  but don't impact readability.
- add qmk keymap reading (this would be a cool/useless feature that would parse your keymap.c data and automagically update your overlay when you change your keymap)
- add layer support (for now I only have two layers, but this might be needed if I want to do more with qmk down the line).
